# Criminal-Detection-System
Various recent advancements in deep
learning models have greatly boosted the performance
of semantic pattern recognition using images.

Various state estimation of an individual like emotional
state and other certain character features or
traits can be estimated from the facial images. 

We have used in this study: standard convolutional neural
network(CNN) architecture and pre-trained CNN
architectures, namely VGG-16, VGG-19, and InceptionV3.
We have done a performance comparative
analysis among these models for efficiently capturing
criminal traits from a human face.

The efficacy of the above deep learning models was evaluated on
a public database, National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST).
To avoid any discrepancies,
we have only used male images in this work.

It was found that VGG CNN models are best performing
models, especially in a limited data scenario producing
the classification accuracy of 99:5% in identifying
criminal faces.
